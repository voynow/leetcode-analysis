# leetcode
drilling coding interview problems, getting reacclimated to data structures/algorithms,  focusing in on the fundamentals of python

In February I was sort of cramming for iterview prep. I feel as if I learned a lot very quickly, but this was certainly not optimal. Instead, six months later, I plan to take a slow & steady approach to studying. Here and there I will drill some LeetCode and other data engineering/data science principles - and then when the day inevitably comes, I will be prepared to interview once again.
